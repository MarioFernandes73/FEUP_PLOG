#Practical Assignment 2

The objective of this project was the development of a program with logic programming with restrictions to resolve an optimization problem.
The problem which I chose was one in which i had to schedule a TV guide for a week, based on:
* The number of slots which I had to fill
* The score of the available series on the database (correspondent to each individual slots)
* The cost of the available series on the database
* The restrictions of each individual series (ex: serie X could not be shown in a certain time of the day)
* The restrictions of series based on eachother (ex: serie X could not be shown on the same day of serie Y)
* etc.

The assignment also had to have a written article (which was done in latex).
