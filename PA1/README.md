#Practical Assignment 1

In this assignment it was expected that the students developed a tabletop game for 2 players.
This game is characterized by the type of board, pieces, movement of the pieces and by the ending conditions.
It was expected to develop an application to play this game using Prolog and the game had to allow 3 game modes: Human vs Human, Human vs CPU, CPU vs CPU
The CPU had to have at least 2 levels of intelligence.

The game which I developed is called [Blockade](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2559/blockade)
